# n8n Agent Builder

Source: @the.wealth.lab "6 Favorite Claude Skills That Automate Almost Anything."

> Create complete n8n workflows, AI agents, automations, and integrations with Claude — without starting from scratch. Turn repetitive tasks into automated workflows and save hours of development time.

## What this skill does

Turns a described business process or automation goal into a concrete n8n implementation plan:
- Chooses the right trigger (webhook, schedule, app event, manual)
- Maps the node sequence: trigger → data transformation → conditions → actions → error handling
- Identifies which n8n built-in nodes and community nodes are needed
- Produces a human-readable workflow description AND a pasteable n8n JSON skeleton where the logic is deterministic enough to pre-build
- Flags credentials and API keys the user will need to supply

## Workflow design process

1. **Clarify the trigger** — What starts this workflow? (A form submission, a new row in a spreadsheet, a time schedule, an inbound webhook from another tool?)
2. **Map the happy path** — Step by step from trigger to final action: what data flows, what gets transformed, what gets sent where?
3. **Add conditions and branches** — If X, do Y; if not, do Z. Error paths belong here too.
4. **Select nodes** — Match each step to an n8n node (HTTP Request, IF, Set, Code, OpenAI, Gmail, Slack, Airtable, etc.)
5. **Output the spec** — Produce a numbered node list with connection map, then the JSON skeleton.

## Copy-paste prompt to use

```
You are an expert n8n workflow builder.

I want to automate: [DESCRIBE THE TASK OR PROCESS]

My tools/apps involved: [LIST APPS, e.g. Gmail, Airtable, Slack, OpenAI, Notion]
Trigger: [WHAT STARTS THE WORKFLOW, e.g. "new email arrives", "every morning at 8am", "form submitted"]
End result: [WHAT SHOULD HAPPEN AT THE END]

Please:
1. Design the full workflow step by step (trigger → nodes → final action)
2. Identify every n8n node I need (built-in and community)
3. Note which credentials/API keys I must supply
4. Give me a pasteable n8n JSON skeleton for the workflow
5. Flag anything I'd need to test or adjust before going live

Be specific. Don't give me vague steps — give me exact node names and connection logic.
```

## Common automation patterns

| Goal | Trigger | Key nodes |
|---|---|---|
| Lead capture → CRM | Webhook / Form | HTTP Request, Set, Airtable/HubSpot |
| Daily report email | Schedule | HTTP Request, Code (format), Gmail |
| AI email triage | Gmail trigger | OpenAI (classify), IF, Gmail (label/reply) |
| New row → Slack alert | Airtable/Sheets trigger | Set, Slack |
| Content to social post | Manual / webhook | OpenAI, HTTP Request (social API) |
| Customer onboarding | Webhook | Wait, Email, Slack, CRM update |
