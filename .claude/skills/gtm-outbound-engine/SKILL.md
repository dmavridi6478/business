name: gtm-outbound-engine
description: Design and run a B2B outbound engine as five layers — orchestration (Claude Code as the single control plane), signal (hiring surges, tech adoption, funding, LinkedIn engagement), data (waterfall enrichment to verified email/phone/firmographics), action (email on proper inbox infrastructure or LinkedIn sequences) and system of record (one CRM everything writes back to) — executed as a 5-step pipeline inside Claude Code - pull and enrich, clean/dedupe/normalise, extract signals and score ICP, write 1:1 personalisation, push to sender. Maps each layer to the MCP connectors actually available in this account (Clay, Vibe Prospecting, OpenFunnel, HubSpot, Apollo-style providers) and ships a working lead-cleaning script. Use when building or auditing an outbound/GTM/RevOps stack, choosing enrichment or sequencing tools, or asked to "run outbound from Claude Code". Upstream of `outbound-campaign-brief` (campaign + approval gate) and `linkedin-signal-outreach`.

# GTM Outbound Engine

Sources (uploaded infographics):
- "The 5-layer GTM engine — from signal detection to a CRM record, fully automated with AI agents" (Cold IQ / Julien Lieben) — the layer model and 14-tool stack.
- "The All-in-One Outbound Pipeline — Everything you need to run high-converting outbound. Inside Claude Code." — the 5-step execution flow.

Both are vendor marketing (Cold IQ sells a unified GTM API). The architecture is sound; "fully automated" is not — see Gates.

## The five layers (bottom-up = build order)

| # | Layer | Job | Tools named in source | Connected in this account |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Orchestration | Reads API docs, wires the other four layers, retries through errors | Claude, OpenAI, Cold IQ | Claude Code (this session), `n8n-agent-builder` for scheduled runs |
| 2 | Signal | Detect hiring surges, tech adoption, funding rounds, LinkedIn engagement before competitors | PredictLeads, LimaData, GetLeads | OpenFunnel (`search-companies-by-tech-stack`, `deep-research`), HubSpot `search_intent_signals`, Clay |
| 3 | Data | Raw signals → verified emails, phones, firmographics via waterfall enrichment | Cold IQ, Apollo, Explorium, Prospeo, FullEnrich, GetLeads, LeadMagic | Clay (`add-contact-data-points`), Vibe Prospecting (`enrich-prospects`, `enrich-business`) |
| 4 | Action | Route contacts to the right channel: high-volume email on inbox infrastructure that lands, or LinkedIn sequences | Instantly, Hypertide, Expandi | None connected — export CSV (Vibe Prospecting `export-to-csv`) and import |
| 5 | System of record | Every signal, enrichment and reply writes back to one CRM | folk | HubSpot (`search_crm_objects`, `get_crm_objects`), Airtable |

The full 14-tool stack from the source: Cold IQ, Apollo, Explorium, PredictLeads, LimaData, Prospeo, FullEnrich, GetLeads, Openmart, Instantly, Expandi, Hypertide, LeadMagic, folk. **[Certain]** these are the names on the graphic; **[Guessing]** on current pricing/availability — verify each before buying.

## The 5-step pipeline (inside Claude Code)

| Step | What happens | How here |
|---|---|---|
| 1. Pull data & waterfall enrichment | Query provider A; for every field still empty, try provider B, then C | Clay / Vibe Prospecting MCP; record which provider filled each field |
| 2. Clean, deduplicate, normalise | Standardise job titles, company domains, drop duplicates | `python3 scripts/clean_leads.py in.csv out.csv` (this skill) |
| 3. Extract signals & score ICP | Read live web/job/news signals; score against explicit ICP criteria | OpenFunnel / HubSpot intent / `WebFetch`; scoring rubric below |
| 4. Write 1:1 personalisation | Multi-touch sequence grounded in the account's real signal | Prompt below; drafts only |
| 5. Push to sender | Format clean records, push to Instantly / Smartlead / Outreach | CSV export + manual import until a sender connector exists |

## ICP scoring rubric (step 3)

Score 0–3 per criterion, weight, sum to 100. Define before you pull data, not after.

| Criterion | Weight | 0 | 3 |
|---|---|---|---|
| Firmographic fit (industry, size, region) | 30 | Outside | Exact match |
| Trigger signal in last 90 days (hire, funding, tech change) | 30 | None | Direct trigger for your offer |
| Role fit of contact (decision power) | 20 | No influence | Economic buyer |
| Reachability (verified email, deliverable domain) | 10 | Unverified | Verified |
| Negative signals (competitor customer, layoffs, lawsuit) | −10 | — | Present |

Tier A ≥ 75, B 55–74, below 55 not contacted.

## Gates (non-negotiable)

1. **Lawful basis before step 1** (EU/GDPR): B2B legitimate interest needs a documented balancing test, a source-of-data notice in the first email, and a working opt-out. Greece/EU ePrivacy rules on unsolicited email to individuals apply to named personal addresses. **[Likely]**
2. **Human approval before step 5.** Use `outbound-campaign-brief` for the approval gate and send cap.
3. **Deliverability before volume**: separate sending domains, SPF/DKIM/DMARC, warm-up, < 50 sends per inbox per day. **[Likely]**
4. **No invented personalisation**: every personal line must cite the signal it came from.

## Step 4 prompt

```
You write first-touch B2B emails for {{company}} selling {{offer}}.
Account: {{account_json}}  Signal: {{signal}} (source: {{signal_url}}, date: {{signal_date}})
Write 3 touches (day 0, 3, 8). Touch 1 ≤ 90 words: line 1 references the signal factually, line 2 connects it to one problem we solve, line 3 one proof point from {{proof_rows}}, CTA a single yes/no question.
Never invent facts not present in the account or signal. Output JSON: {"touches":[{"day","subject","body"}],"signal_cited":true}.
```
