name: one-person-sales-system
description: Build an automated pipeline that turns content viewers into paying clients without sales calls, cold outreach, or a sales team. Use when someone has content driving attention but no system converting it into clients, is manually DMing/calling every lead, or asks for a lead-capture-to-close funnel a solo operator can run.

# One-Person Sales System

Source: stage 4 of the 5-prompt "Dan Koe-style one-person business system"
carousel (@yourgptguide) reviewed from an uploaded photo batch — see
`one-person-business-idea`'s SKILL.md for the full sourcing note (marketing
hype in the framing, prompt content itself kept).

Stage 4 of 5 (idea → offer → content system → **sales system** → scaling).
Assumes `one-person-content-system` (or equivalent) is already driving
viewers — this skill converts that attention into paying clients.

## What this does

Maps the full path from "sees a piece of content" to "paying client" and
designs each handoff (lead capture, nurture, conversion) so the whole thing
runs without the operator manually chasing every lead or getting on a call.

## How to run it

1. Ask for the offer, content platforms, and current client-acquisition
   method before designing anything.
2. Map the customer journey from first piece of content seen to paying
   client — every step in between, not just the endpoints.
3. Design a lead capture system: how a content viewer becomes an email
   subscriber (or equivalent owned channel).
4. Build a nurture sequence: how a subscriber becomes a buyer without a
   sales call.
5. Create a conversion mechanism: the specific trigger that turns a
   subscriber into a client.

## Rules

- The system must require zero sales calls to function — that's the point
  of a *one-person* sales system.
- Every step must be executable by one person.
- The nurture sequence must deliver real value before it asks for
  anything — sequence the give before the ask.
- The conversion mechanism must feel natural, never pushy or desperate.

## Output

Customer Journey Map → Lead Capture → Nurture Sequence → Conversion
Mechanism → Automated Sales Flow
